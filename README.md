  primary: {
    50: '#eff6ff',
    // ... other shades
    900: '#1e3a8a',

    900: '#0f172a',
  }
}
```

### Components

All components are located in the `src/components/` directory and can be easily modified or extended. Each component is self-contained with its own styling using Tailwind CSS classes.
