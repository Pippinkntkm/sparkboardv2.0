# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Repository name: `Sparkboard-V2.0`
5. Description: `A modern React and Tailwind CSS website baseline`
6. Make it **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
7. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
8. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect and Push to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Sparkboard-V2.0.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: Using SSH (if you have SSH keys set up)

If you prefer SSH, use this instead:

```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/Sparkboard-V2.0.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify

After pushing, you should see your code on GitHub at:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Sparkboard-V2.0`

## Next Steps

Once the repository is set up, you can:
- Enable GitHub Pages for live deployment
- Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Add collaborators
- Create issues and projects

Your SparkBoard Website 2.0 is now ready to be shared and collaborated on!
